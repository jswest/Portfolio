  <p>Until 1923, with the exception of four men executed by firing squad during the Civil War, Texas sent condemned men to the gallows. In 1977, the state chose lethal injection as the means of execution, and in 1982, Charlie Brooks, Jr. became the first man in Texas to die by the needle. His last words, duly recorded by the state that would kill him, praised Allah: “Verily unto Allah do we belong; verily unto him do we return. Be strong.” Seven minutes later, if all went according to plan, he would be dead.</p>
  <p>In most states, lethal injection is a three-step process. It begins with the injection of a sedative, usually sodium thiopental—a drug that, as Rachel Maddow points out, is more commonly known as ‘truth serum.’ Then the prisoner is injected with pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxant that collapses the diaphragm and lungs. Finally potassium chloride is administered to stop the heart.</p>
  <p>In late 2010, the U.S. faced a shortage of sodium thiopental. In January of that year, the only American manufacturer of sodium thiopental had halted production. In response, the state of Georgia illegally bought the drug from Dream Pharma, which, according to the BBC, is based out of a London driving school. The state used the drug in two executions before the DEA intervened. If they hadn’t stepped in, the state of Georgia would have used the illicitly purchased sodium thiopental in the recent execution of Troy Davis.</p>
  <p>Now Georgia, along with Texas and many other states, uses pentobarbital in the first step of their executions. Pentobarbital is a pet tranquilizer, used by veterinarians to put down animals.</p>
