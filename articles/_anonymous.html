<p>In late 2009, Greg Hoglund, head and founder of the respected computer security firm HBGary, announced the creation of HBGary Federal, a related company, “with a focus on contracting in the government space.” HBGary would own 15 percent of HBGary Federal outright, and various members of HBGary would own substantial shares of HBGary Federal. Hoglund hired a man named Aaron Barr— whom he glowingly described as an “A+ player”—to lead the new company. Barr was plucked from the military contracting giant Northrop Grumman, fresh from his success in transforming its cyber security campaign into a ten-million-dollar-a-year computer security division.</p>
<p>Just shy of two years later, Barr was ready to add another feather to his cap. Under the ludicrous alias “Julian Goodspeak,” he infiltrated a loose group of hackers calling themselves “Anonymous” that had become famous for its attacks on high-profile targets ranging from Bank of America to the Egyptian government. Given Anonymous’s unpopularity among some of the world’s most powerful corporations and governments, Barr believed he could turn his infiltration into notoriety—and money—for HBGary and its child company, HBGary Federal. He was already sending out tantalizing emails to potential clients, including a host of three-letter Government acronyms—the FBI, CIA, DNI, DOJ, etc.—and the company was preparing to present Barr’s findings at a major computer security conference.</p>
<p>The mood at HBGary Federal was jubilant. Internally, they took credit for nearly fifty worldwide raids of suspected Anonymous members. They drafted grandiose press releases with titles like “HBGary Federal Pwns Anonymous,” including phrases like “this is a proud day” and “this underscores the need for new blood in the intelligence community.” Unable to restrain himself, Barr gave the story to the <em>Financial Times</em>, and just as he and HBGary Federal hoped—and expected—it started blowing up. 60 Minutes wanted Barr toappear as a guest. Hoglund, essentially Barr’s boss, wrote this gloating email:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should post this on front page, throw out some tweets. “HBGary Federal sets a new bar as private intelligence agency.” – the pun on bar is intended lol.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two days later, Anonymous members hacked into HBGary and HBGary Federal’s servers, spilling tens of thousands of Barr’s emails across the web, stealing proprietary information, hijacking his Twitter feed, and, for good measure, remotely wiping his iPad.</p>
<p>The leaked emails—in addition to exposing embarrassing tidbits like Barr’s World of Warcraft handle (Sevrynsten, if you’re wondering) and details of his disintegrating marriage—revealed deep connections between powerful corporations, the United States Government, and computer security firms. For their clients, HBGary and HBGary Federal conducted in- depth opposition research (which included plans to blackmail journalists and entrap and discredit liberal activists) and they created and planned to sell extremely sophisticated, and hitherto unknown, methods for taking over computers. The corporations involved have since pled ignorance or issued denials. Fellow computer security firms labeled HBGary little more than a bad apple. Members of Congress called for hearings.</p>
<p>Within a month, HBGary’s high-profile partners and clients had jumped ship and Barr had resigned in disgrace.</p>
